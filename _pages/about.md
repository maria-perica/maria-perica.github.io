## About Me 

I am a clinical research scientist whose research bridges neuroscience and psychology to understand how environment impacts brain development. I am proficient in a variety of statistical and quantiative tools, as well as in working directly with clinical populations. In my research, I implement mixed-effects, multi-level, and longitudinal models, primarily using R, to work with cognitive, behavioral, survey, and neuroimaging data to study the neurobiological basis of adolescent cognitive development. In my clinical work, I use CBT and ACT primarily, but also have experience with DBT. Previously, I have also worked with animal models and have experience with histology and microscopy as well.
