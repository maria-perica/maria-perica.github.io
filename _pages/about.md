## About Me 

I am a clinical research scientist studying how environmental factors and substance use influence brain development during adolescence. My work bridges neuroscience and psychology, integrating cognitive, behavioral, survey, and neuroimaging data to examine the neurobiological basis of adolescent development. I use R to implement mixed-effects, multilevel, and longitudinal models, and am experienced in working with both clinical and research populations. Clinically, I primarily use CBT and ACT, with additional training in DBT.

I earned my Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from the University of Pittsburgh under the mentorship of Dr. Beatriz Luna and completed my Psychology Internship at the Charleston Consortium (MUSC + VA). I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Medical University of South Carolina with Dr. Lindsay Squeglia.
