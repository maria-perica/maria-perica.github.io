# Research Experience

### 2025 – Present  
**Postdoctoral Fellow**  
*Addiction Sciences Division, Department of Psychiatry, Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC)*  
**Primary Investigator:** Lindsay Squeglia, Ph.D.  
- Postdoctoral training focuses on gaining expertise in multi-modal neuroimaging, big data methodology, advanced quantitative/statistical methods, and clinical trial methodology.

### 2024 – 2025  
**Predoctoral Psychology Intern Researcher**  
*Addiction Sciences Division, Department of Psychiatry, MUSC*  
**Primary Investigator:** Lindsay Squeglia, Ph.D.  
- Investigated adolescent development of neurometabolites linked to neural plasticity, and how alcohol use affects these processes.  
- Expanded expertise in youth alcohol/substance use disorders and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).

### 2018 – 2024  
**Graduate Student Researcher**  
*Laboratory of Neurocognitive Development, University of Pittsburgh*  
**Primary Investigator:** Beatriz Luna, Ph.D.  
- Studied adolescent neurodevelopment, focusing on neurometabolites related to plasticity, cognitive development, and environmental influences.  
- Developed a novel analytic/statistical pipeline for 7T MRSI data (R01 MH067924).  
- Gained expertise in neuroimaging, R programming, longitudinal analysis, and mixed-effects modeling.

**Postbaccalaureate Intramural Research Training Award (IRTA) Fellow**  
*Systems Neuroscience Imaging Resource, National Institutes of Health (NIH)*  
**Primary Investigator:** Theodore Usdin, M.D., Ph.D.  
- Created a high-throughput imaging pipeline to quantify c-Fos-labeled neural activity in mice.  
- Acquired hands-on experience with mouse models, histology, CLARITY, microscopy, and perfusion techniques.

### 2013 – 2016  
**Research Assistant**  
*Neurobiology of Cognition Laboratory, New York University*  
**Primary Investigator:** Andre Fenton, Ph.D.  
- Examined altered neural plasticity in a rodent model of schizophrenia across adolescence to adulthood, and its impact on cognitive control.  
- Trained in rodent behavioral tasks, histology, and microscopy.
