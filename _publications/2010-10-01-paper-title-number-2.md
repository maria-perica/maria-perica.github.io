excerpt: 'In this paper, we leveraged prospective data collected prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to understand how individual connectivity patterns varied with levels of anxiety and worry about the pandemic. We found that more adult-like connectivity between the vmPFC and pHPC was associated with greater worry during the pandemic in adolescents.'
