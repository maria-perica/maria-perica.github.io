title: "Impact of stress on excitatory and inhibitory markers of adolescent cognitive critical period plasticity"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Perica_Luna_NBR_2023
excerpt: 'In this narrative review paper that I wrote for my comprehensive examination, we propose a model of how stressful experiences during adolescence can impact developmental trajectories of excitatory and inhibitory function. We consider acute and chronic dimensions of stress, and contextualize these experiences within the context of adolescence as a developmental critical period for cognitive function.'
