excerpt: 'Adolescence is a critical period for neurometabolic maturation and is typically when alcohol use is initiated. Using 3T magnetic resonance spectroscopy in 84 adolescents (ages=17–22), 
we observed age-related increases in metabolites supporting neuronal health, membrane synthesis, glial function, inhibitory neurotransmission,
and decreases in excitatory neurotransmission. More alcohol use was associated with lower levels of a metabolite linked to neuronal health. 
These findings clarify developmental patterns of neurometabolites and highlight a potential biomarker for early alcohol-related disruption 
during adolescence. />'
